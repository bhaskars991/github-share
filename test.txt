What is a Whole-Food Plant-Based Diet?
But first, what exactly is a whole-food, plant-based diet? Although there are some variations to plant-based diets, here are the main points:

Excludes the majority (or entirety) of animal products (meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy).
Includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts (hint: plant-based-diet) and seeds in their whole, natural form (or minimally processed).
Excludes refined food and highly processed food, even if derived from plants.
Excludes added sugars and artificial colors, flavors and additives.

Now you may be wondering, how do we know that this is the way to go? Well, for that, we can thank science. Several studies have found the benefits of eating a plant-predominant diet. One which emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods over animal foods.

Top 3 reasons to try a Whole-Food Plant-Based Diet
Here are the top 3 reasons why a predominantly plant-based diet makes sense:

1. Plant-based diets prevent and may treat diseases.
More and more we are seeing how our dietary choices influence our health and disease risk. As a matter of fact, nearly half of adults in the U.S. have one or more preventable chronic diseases (think diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, obesity and certain cancers).  Many of these are caused by poor dietary habits and lifestyle choices (1).  A plant-based diet may be just what the doctor ordered.

Fruits and vegetables are exceptionally high in vitamins and minerals, allowing them to act as antioxidants. Antioxidants protect our cells from damage and stress caused by free radicals (unstable molecules that cause illness and aging).
Whole grains such as rice, oats, quinoa, etc. are rich in fiber, which support digestion, reduce cholesterol, and help maintain a healthy gut.
Legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils, soybeans) are protein-powerhouses.  These help us build and maintain muscle while staying lean thanks to being loaded with fiber.
Nuts and seeds are abundant in what we call the “good fats” and are the best sources of omega-3 in plants. Omega-3 is essential to maintain healthy brain cells, reduce inflammation and prevent heart disease.
All these qualities of plant foods make them powerful in fighting disease!

Studies have shown that a plant-based diet lowers the risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular (disease of the heart), diabetes, obesity, as well as most cancers.  However, although genetics play a large role in cancer, several studies have shown that lifestyle choices can turn cancer genes on and off. In fact, there are several success stories of cancer patients with advanced disease stages who reversed their illness following a whole food, plant-based diet!

Heart Disease and Blood Pressure
Cardiovascular diseases are caused by buildup of plaque in arteries that prevents proper blood flow. This can be a result of a poor diet (high in saturated fats and added sugars), physical inactivity and smoking. The inadequate blood flow can cause heart failure, stroke, and death.

Plant-based foods, which are high in fiber and lower in saturated fat, help cleanse our arteries and promote good blood flow. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is when the force of the blood against the walls of arteries is too high. If untreated, it can lead to heart complications (heart attack) and diabetes.

Studies have shown that a plant-predominant diet significantly decreases high blood pressure - but what is most impressive is that the blood pressure reduction was independent of the person’s weight and exercise levels… that’s how powerful your diet can be! (2,3)

Diabetes
The risk of developing type II diabetes occurs when our bodies can no longer process glucose (sugar from carbohydrates), causing blood sugar levels to be dangerously high. This is called insulin resistance and is mostly caused by poor dietary choices or excess fat surrounding cells. Glucose is our main source of energy and is essential for cells to function, but very high levels in the blood can cause nerve damage, loss of sight, and kidney failure. Plant-based diets have been found to be almost twice as effective than conventional treatments due to their ability to improve insulin sensitivity, blood sugar control and reducing body weight. (4,5,6)

High Cholesterol
Cholesterol is an essential molecule that our body needs to create cell membranes (the wall of our cells). When taking your blood cholesterol levels, you will notice different values: total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol), HDL-cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) and triglycerides (how our bodies store fat).

Our body produces its own cholesterol to build and maintain healthy cells. However, high cholesterol levels, especially total cholesterol and LDL levels, are known to cause buildup in our arteries, which is a culprit for heart disease and stroke.

High cholesterol levels are caused by consumption of saturated fats in our diet, which are mostly found in animal proteins and dairy products. Studies have shown that plant-based diets are able to lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, reducing risk for cholesterol-related diseases. (7)

How plant-based-diet keeps you healthy: With plant-based-diet, we are nuts about nuts. That’s because they are tiny nutritional powerhouses. As you may have noticed, our products contain one and only ingredient: either almonds or cashews, both of which contain tons of powerful nutrients.

Disease-Fighting Ingredients:
Almonds are one of the best sources of vitamin E. As a matter of fact, a handful of almonds provides almost half of the daily recommended amount of vitamin E!

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it only gets absorbed with foods that contain fat (hint: plant-based-diet). The main function of vitamin E is to work as an antioxidant, which protects the body from damage, stress and disease. In fact, vitamin E has been found to have a protective effect against heart disease, cancer, and eye damage!

Similarly, cashews also have strong antioxidant power because they contain lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants found in our eyes. Like almonds, cashews also protect our eyes from age-related damage and macular degeneration as we get older. (8)

Almonds and cashews are also great sources of magnesium, a mineral involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, including muscle function (such as keeping our heartbeat - no big deal), and creating energy from the foods you eat. Magnesium also helps support a healthy immune system and keep strong bones! One handful of either almonds or cashews has about 20 percent of the recommended daily intake.

2. Plant-based diets help with weight loss and weight management
When it comes to weight loss, it’s important to note that this can be achieved through a healthful and balanced diet.  That means, one that is reasonable and sustainable ("diet" here meaning your dietary choices rather than fad diets.)

The foods we choose to consume are far more significant to our health than the amount of calories they contain (for example, a chocolate chip cookie has 150 calories, but half an apple with a spoonful of peanut butter also has 150 calories...you get where we are going with this right?) So, rather than counting your calories, focus on consuming highly nutritious food to support a healthy weight, boost energy levels, improve digestion, prevent disease and live a happy life!

Now, we’ve all heard fiber helps us lose weight. But have you heard that plant foods are the only ones that have fiber? No, we are not kidding; fiber is only found in plants!

Fiber should be your BFF because it keeps you regular (healthy poop, healthy you!).

And, fiber is also the big player in lowering cholesterol levels, keeping a healthy gut flora, and helping with weight management. Fiber contributes bulk in the diet without adding digestible calories, thus leading to satiety and weight loss. Because they are high in fiber, plant foods are lower in calories (not that we are counting, because we aren’t…) while delivering tons of nutrients.

Another plus of fiber is that it slows the absorption of glucose, meaning that you won’t have spikes in your blood sugar (aka sugar high and sugar crash). This makes you less likely to devour a tub of ice cream in the afternoon (hey, no judgement...we’ve all been there).

Research shows that plant-based diets are highly effective as a weight loss approach when compared to other diets, and significantly lower BMI and waist circumference numbers. Plus, plant-based diets offer a large variety of foods without requiring calorie counting or calorie restrictions, so they are easier to sustain overtime. (9,10)

What does stress do to the body?
Stress triggers the hypothalamus region at the base of your brain, which sends off hormonal and nerve warning signals throughout your body. As a result, your adrenal glands release cortisol and adrenaline.

Cortisol—the stress hormone—suppresses functions that your body doesn’t need in a fight-or-flight situation. This includes certain immune system responses, your digestive system, your reproductive system, and growth processes. In turn, it releases simple sugars (glucose) into your bloodstream, enhances your brain’s use of glucose, and increases the availability of substances that repair tissues.

Meanwhile, adrenaline boosts your energy levels, increases your heart rate, and elevates your blood pressure. After the perceived threat is over, your cortisol levels usually normalize so your body can resume its normal functions. But, if stressors are always present, then you might stay in fight-or-flight mode. 

Over time, chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure, sleep problems, headaches, gut problems, trouble concentrating, anxiety, depression, and an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke. According to the Mayo Clinic, everyone reacts to it differently, depending on genetics, life experiences, and how you manage stress.

Does diet affect stress?
So, what does science say about the diet-stress relationship? Certain foods can help lower cortisol while others have been linked to stress and anxiety. 

Research shows that diets with a strong emphasis on whole, plant-based foods are associated with lower stress, anxiety, and depression. These foods include fruit, vegetables, grains, and legumes and encourage little use of oil and salt. Meanwhile, eating a lot of highly processed foods that are high in added sugars, refined grains, and saturated fats is linked to higher cortisol levels. 

But, mastering the relationship between nutrition and stress isn’t always so straightforward. Chronic stress can make it harder for you to eat the foods that are known to help combat stress, Rhyan Geiger, RDN and owner of Phoenix Vegan Dietitian, tells VegNews.

“When experiencing stress people often crave foods that are higher in fat and sugar. Sometimes stress can even create a feeling of decreased motivation which leads to skipping or forgetting meals,” she says. 

These cravings for highly processed foods are due to increased cortisol levels. Geiger adds: “When adrenaline is increased from stress, it can decrease appetite.”

While diet does play a role in how you experience stress, there are ways to reduce stress beyond eating your vegetables and avoiding highly processed foods. 

This includes staying hydrated, adequate sleep, getting enough physical activity, and reducing alcohol and caffeine. 

A professional could also help if it’s available to you. “If you find that your stress is not improving, reach out to a mental health expert like a therapist for stress management techniques,” Geiger says.

Vegan foods that can help relieve stress and anxiety
In general, you should avoid highly processed foods and gravitate towards meals made from whole, plant-based ingredients.

Keep in mind that not all packaged foods count as “highly processed.” Frozen pizza, fried food, deli meats, bacon, most fast food, cookies, and snack cakes count as highly-processed, but frozen or canned vegetables, frozen fruit, canned beans, and whole grain pasta are considered healthy and convenient.

1-Magnesium-rich food
Magnesium plays a vital role in stress and anxiety levels and has a strong influence on the part of the brain that regulates stress hormones. Hypomagnesemia—also known as magnesium deficiency—is associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. Research shows that a higher magnesium intake could help reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.

“Foods like Swiss chard, nuts and seeds, legumes, and whole grains all have magnesium to help with the body’s stress response,” Geiger says. As far as nuts and seeds are concerned, almonds, cashews, and pumpkin seeds are good sources of magnesium.

Other magnesium-rich foods include tofu, kale, spinach, collard greens, oats, avocados, bananas, and dark chocolate. A magnesium-rich breakfast could look like oatmeal with banana, nuts, and seeds or a tofu scramble with spinach and whole grain toast.


2-Anti-inflammatory foods
Untreated, chronic inflammation can contribute to heart disease, arthritis, and depression over time, according to Hope Ricciotti, MD, and Toni Golen, MD, editors in chief of the Harvard Women’s Health Watch. And, research shows that psychological stress can cause physical inflammation in your body. Anti-inflammatory foods could help your body combat one of the effects of stress.

“Because stress can increase cortisol and elevated levels of cortisol can cause inflammation, foods that decrease inflammation are ideal,” Geiger says. “Food rich in color, like berries and sweet potatoes are a good source of antioxidants to reduce inflammation.”

Other anti-inflammatory vegan foods include dark leafy greens, tomatoes, almonds, walnuts, oranges, and extra virgin olive oil. Limit the foods that cause inflammation, such as refined carbohydrates, fried foods, red meat, processed meat, soda, and other sugary beverages.

3-Prebiotic-rich foods
There are hundreds of trillions of microorganisms living in your gut, working hard to break down food and bolster your immune system. These tiny living things feed on prebiotics, a compound found in fermentable soluble fibers such as resistant starches, inulin, and pectin.

Resistant starches are present in food that has been cooked and cooled, like potatoes, oats, rice, legumes, and green bananas. Reheating the food after cooling won’t affect the resistant starch levels. Inulin is found in many fruits and vegetables, including asparagus, burdock root, chicory root, soybeans, onions, leeks, garlic, and dandelion greens.

Pectin, a starch found in fruit, is often used to make jams and as an alternative to gelatin in some vegan candies. You can get it from apples, pears, plums, guava, peaches, strawberries, and oranges. Some vegetables—carrots, peas, green beans, and tomatoes—contain pectin, too.

There is still so much that we don’t know about the human gut’s influence on overall health. There is even contradictory information surrounding probiotic-rich fermented foods’ effect on stress and anxiety. According to a systematic review of the probiotic food-stress relationship, some studies have shown that they have a positive effect. However, others indicate that probiotics may actually increase stress levels.

The secret to better health is exercise

Whether you're 9 or 90, abundant evidence shows exercise can enhance your health and well-being. But for many people, sedentary pastimes, such as watching TV, surfing the Internet, or playing computer and video games, have replaced more active pursuits.

What exercise can do for you
Millions of Americans simply aren't moving enough to meet the minimum threshold for good health — that is, burning at least 700 to 1,000 calories a week through physical pursuits. The benefits of exercise may sound too good to be true, but decades of solid science confirm that exercise improves health and can extend your life. Adding as little as half an hour of moderately intense physical activity to your day can help you avoid a host of serious ailments, including heart disease, diabetes, depression, and several types of cancer, particularly breast and colon cancers. Regular exercise can also help you sleep better, reduce stress, control your weight, brighten your mood, sharpen your mental functioning, and improve your sex life.

A well-rounded exercise program has four components: aerobic activity, strength training, flexibility training, and balance exercises. Each benefits your body in a different way.

Fighting disease with aerobic activity
Aerobic exercise is the centerpiece of any fitness program. Nearly all of the research regarding the disease-fighting benefits of exercise revolves around cardiovascular activity, which includes walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling. Experts recommend working out at moderate intensity when you perform aerobic exercise — brisk walking that quickens your breathing is one example. This level of activity is safe for almost everyone and provides the desired health benefits. Additional health benefits may flow from increased intensity.

Protecting bone with strength training
Strength or resistance training, such as elastic-band workouts and the use of weight machines or free weights, is important for building muscle and protecting bone.

Bones lose calcium and weaken with age, but strength training can help slow or sometimes even reverse this trend. Not only can strength training make you look and feel better, but it can also result in better performance of everyday activities, such as climbing stairs and carrying bundles. Stronger muscles also mean better mobility and balance, and thus a lower risk of falling and injuring yourself. In addition, more lean body mass aids in weight control because each pound of muscle burns more calories than its equivalent in fat.

Easing back pain with flexibility exercises
Stretching or flexibility training is the third prong of a balanced exercise program. Muscles tend to shorten and weaken with age. Shorter, stiffer muscle fibers make you vulnerable to injuries, back pain, and stress. But regularly performing exercises that isolate and stretch the elastic fibers surrounding your muscles and tendons can counteract this process. And stretching improves your posture and balance.

Preventing falls with balance exercises
Balance tends to erode over time, and regularly performing balance exercises is one of the best ways to protect against falls that lead to temporary or permanent disability. Balance exercises take only a few minutes and often fit easily into the warm-up portion of a workout. Many strength-training exercises also serve as balance exercises. Or balance-enhancing movements may simply be woven into other forms of exercise, such as tai chi, yoga, and Pilates.

Exercise at a glance
In a nutshell, exercise can:
reduce your chances of getting heart disease. For those who already have heart disease, exercise reduces the chances of dying from it.
lower your risk of developing hypertension and diabetes.
reduce your risk for colon cancer and some other forms of cancer.
improve your mood and mental functioning.
keep your bones strong and joints healthy.
help you maintain a healthy weight.
help you maintain your independence well into your later years.

Sleep and Health
Not getting enough sleep alters insulin resistance, which is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and that can be very quickly induced by a single night's total sleep loss.

The Takeaway
It can be tempting to trade sleep for a few precious hours of wakefulness, but it is important to consider the hidden costs. Sleep is precious, too.
Numerous studies have found that insufficient sleep increases a person's risk of developing serious medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
Lack of adequate sleep over time has been associated with a shortened lifespan.

The Hidden Costs of Insufficient Sleep
Sleep is often one of the first things to go when people feel pressed for time. Many view sleep as a luxury and think that the benefits of limiting the hours they spend asleep outweigh the costs. People often overlook the potential long-term health consequences of insufficient sleep, and the impact that health problems can ultimately have on one's time and productivity.

Many of the costs of poor sleep go unnoticed. Medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, develop over long periods of time and result from a number of factors, such as genetics, poor nutrition, and lack of exercise. Insufficient sleep has also been linked to these and other health problems, and is considered an important risk factor. Although scientists have just begun to identify the connections between insufficient sleep and disease, most experts have concluded that getting enough high-quality sleep may be as important to health and well-being as nutrition and exercise.


Risk Assessment
Determining the risks posed by insufficient sleep is complicated. Medical conditions are slow to develop and have multiple risk factors connected to them. What we do know is that sleeping fewer than about eight hours per night on a regular basis seems to increase the risk of developing a number of medical conditions. The study results below show that reducing sleep by just two or three hours per night can have dramatic health consequences.

Obesity—Several studies have linked insufficient sleep and weight gain. For example, one study found that people who slept fewer than six hours per night on a regular basis were much more likely to have excess body weight, while people who slept an average of eight hours per night had the lowest relative body fat of the study group.

Another study found that babies who are "short sleepers" are much more likely to develop obesity later in childhood than those who sleep the recommended amount.

Diabetes—Studies have shown that people who reported sleeping fewer than five hours per night had a greatly increased risk of having or developing type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, studies have also found that improved sleep can positively influence blood sugar control and reduce the effects of type 2 diabetes.

Cardiovascular disease and hypertension—A recent study found that even modestly reduced sleep (six to seven hours per night) was associated with a greatly increased the risk of coronary artery calcification, a predictor of future myocardial infarction (heart attack) and death due to heart disease.

There is also growing evidence of a connection between sleep loss caused by obstructive sleep apnea and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and irregular heartbeat.

Immune function—Interactions between sleep and the immune system have been well documented. Sleep deprivation increases the levels of many inflammatory mediators, and infections in turn affect the amount and patterns of sleep.

While scientists are just beginning to understand these interactions, early work suggests that sleep deprivation may decrease the ability to resist infection (see The Common Cold, below).
Common Cold – In a recent study, people who averaged less than seven hours of sleep a night were about three times more likely to develop cold symptoms than study volunteers who got eight or more hours of sleep when exposed to the cold-causing rhinovirus. In addition, those individuals who got better quality sleep were the least likely to come down with a cold. 

Not surprisingly, these potential adverse health effects can add up to increased health care costs and decreased productivity. More importantly, insufficient sleep can ultimately affect life expectancy and day-to-day well-being. An analysis of data from three separate studies suggests that sleeping five or fewer hours per night may increase mortality risk by as much as 15 percent.

Sleeping Well, Staying Healthy
While sleeping well is no guarantee of good health, it does help to maintain many vital functions. One of the most important of these functions may be to provide cells and tissues with the opportunity to recover from the wear and tear of daily life. Major restorative functions in the body such as tissue repair, muscle growth, and protein synthesis occur almost exclusively during sleep.

Many other conclusions about the role sleep plays in maintaining health have come from studying what happens when humans and other animals are deprived of the sleep they need. For example, scientists have discovered that insufficient sleep may cause health problems by altering levels of the hormones involved in such processes as metabolism, appetite regulation, and stress response.

In the meantime, sleep experts say there is ample evidence that shows that when people get the sleep they need, they will not only feel better, but will also increase their odds of living healthier, more productive lives.
